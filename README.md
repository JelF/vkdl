# VKDL - simple script to download your audios from vk.com
## USAGE:
Use vkdl-init if it is a fist run. ~/.config/vkdl.json file with default settings will apear. Beter way is your own application (see vk.com to information how make this), but default is fine too (except it could be banned). Don't forget to edit ROOT of your local library
## SPECIFIC
There is not much naming rules (and also it supports only kirilic and latin in names) right now, so names of some files can look like this:
`________________.mp3`
You can edit regexp rule by yourself in this case. Maybe i will move it to configuration later.
##Thanks
Greetings to Mark Abramov for helping me with ruby itself. I also love github community, becose there was a lot of ready libraries to work with vk.com, so only thing i need - to write a script
PS bevare of loosing all disk space - 10G may be not enought :)
